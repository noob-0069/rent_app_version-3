</br>
Start from the Entry class where we take input and make an object of magic class.</br>
</br>
In magic class the object is created of the corresponding vehicle type.</br>
</br>
Computation of different parameters like fare , distance etc needs to be done for every vehicle so setter class implemeted. Just make an object of it in every vehicle type and code will be reduced.</br>
</br>
The basic class is vehicle and subclasses are created that inherits the vehicle class .</br>
</br>
**##FUTURE---**</br>
</br>
1)Addition of new vehicle very easy ..you need to enter new condition in magic class and also make a corresponding class for new invented vehicle.</br>
</br>
2)Also in case the fare rate of new vehicle is to be calculated upon different parameters just change the funcion in setter class.</br>
</br>
3)Adding multiple cities in trip and instead of manually entering their distances use google.</br>
