# rent_app_version-3
A simple app where you enter the vehicle specs and destination and you will get the fare.</br>
</br>
Different kind of vehicles so I made a parent class vehicle and made subclasses which inherited them.</br>
</br>
For each vehicle we need fare rate and calculation of fare so i made a setter class.</br>
</br>
The main magic class is where the action is taking place...depending upon the vehicle type entered by user I created the corresponding object and printed the fare.</br>
</br>
**##FUTURE---**</br>
1)Addition of new vehicle very easy ..you need to enter new condition in magic class and also make a corresponding class for new invented vehicle.</br>
</br>
2)Also in case the fare rate of new vehicle is to be calculated upon different parameters just change the funcion in setter class.</br>
</br>
3)Adding multiple cities in trip and instead of manually entering their distances use google.</br>
